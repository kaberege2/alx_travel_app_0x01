# 🧭 ALX Travel App - Milestone 3: Listings and Bookings API

This milestone focuses on building API endpoints for managing **Listings** and **Bookings** using Django REST Framework (DRF), with Swagger documentation support for testing and exploration.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is **Milestone 3** of the ALX Travel App series. In this stage, we:

- Created RESTful API endpoints for Listings and Bookings.
- Used `ModelViewSet` from DRF to enable full CRUD support.
- Registered all endpoints under `/api/` using a router.
- Integrated Swagger (drf-yasg) for auto-generated API documentation.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Django 5.2.3
- Django REST Framework 3.16.0
- drf-yasg 1.21.10 (Swagger for API docs)
- django-environ
- PyMySQL

---

## 🧑‍💻 Custom User Model

We use a custom user model with the following roles:

- `guest`
- `host`
- `admin`

Users authenticate via email and have UUID primary keys.
